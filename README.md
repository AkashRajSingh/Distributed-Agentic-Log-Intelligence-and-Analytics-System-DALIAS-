# Distributed Agentic Log Intelligence and Analytics System (DALIAS)

**DALIAS** — A production-style, cloud-native, and scalable Distributed Agentic Log Intelligence and Analytics System that unifies log ingestion, real-time distributed processing, and autonomous AI reasoning for observability and analytics in complex microservice environments.

---

## Overview

Modern cloud-native systems generate massive volumes of distributed logs and telemetry data across multiple services, clusters, and infrastructure layers. Traditional log management tools often struggle with scale, latency, and intelligence — especially when dealing with autonomous operations or real-time root-cause analysis.

DALIAS (Distributed Agentic Log Intelligence and Analytics System) addresses this by combining:

* Distributed event ingestion pipelines
* Real-time stream and batch processing
* Autonomous multi-agent AI reasoning
* Microservice-based, cloud-native architecture

This system is designed to function like a production-ready observability backbone, leveraging technologies such as Kafka, Spark, Docker, and Kubernetes, while embedding intelligent decision-making agents that reason about system health, anomalies, and performance optimization.

## System Architecture

DALIAS follows a modular microservice architecture inspired by the 4+1 Architectural View Model.

### 1. Logical View

Defines major components and their responsibilities:

* Log Ingestion Service → Collects logs and telemetry data from distributed nodes (agents)
* Data Storage Layer → Manages structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data using PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and HDFS
* Stream Processing Layer → Processes data in real-time using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark Streaming
* AI Reasoning Engine → Employs multi-agent reasoning for anomaly detection and root-cause analysis
* Visualization and Dashboard → Provides analytics via Grafana or a custom Streamlit-based UI

### 2. Process View

Handles dynamic behaviors and runtime operations:

* Agents continuously stream telemetry data
* Kafka brokers queue the events
* Spark performs distributed transformations
* AI agents analyze events for insights or incidents
* Dashboards update analytics in near real-time

### 3. Development View

Technology stack overview:

| Layer            | Technology                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Containerization | Docker                                 |
| Orchestration    | Kubernetes                             |
| Data Processing  | Apache Spark, Kafka                    |
| Data Storage     | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, HDFS              |
| AI Reasoning     | Python (LangChain / Autonomous agents) |
| Visualization    | Grafana / Streamlit                    |
| Monitoring       | Prometheus                             |

### 4. Physical View

Deployment diagram (typical production topology):

* Each microservice containerized via Docker
* Kubernetes orchestrates distributed deployment
* Kafka and Spark clusters scale horizontally
* Persistent volumes manage stateful components
* Optional agent nodes deployed across servers

### 5. Scenario View (Use Case)

**Example Scenario:**

1. Application microservices generate logs
2. DALIAS agent on each node streams logs to Kafka topics
3. Spark performs distributed parsing, enrichment, and anomaly scoring
4. AI agents interpret anomalies, correlate events, and generate insights
5. Dashboard displays live insights and historical analytics
